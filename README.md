### Introduction
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and Java.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, MySQL.
- 🔧 The skills I have are Python, MySQL and HTML.
- 🔥 I want to become a data scientist who can handle servers and databases.

I'm a highschool student now! I started studying Python in 2021 and I know there is still a lot more to learn. I know that I'm not actually good at writing codes and my codes have tons of problems, so if you find a problem that have to fix in codes, Please don't hesitate to send us a PR. I'd appreciate it!
