### Hey, I'm Charlesbrown K <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> !


### Introduction 👏
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and Java.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, MySQL.
- 🔧 The skills I have are Python, MySQL and HTML.
- 🔥 I want to become a data scientist who can handle servers and databases.

I'm a highschool student now! I started studying Python in 2021 and I know there is still a lot more to learn. I know that I'm not actually good at writing codes and my codes have tons of problems, so if you find a problem that have to fix in codes, Please don't hesitate to send us a PR. I'd appreciate it!
