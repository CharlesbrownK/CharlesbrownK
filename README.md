- 👋 Hi, I’m @Junghoon-Kim(or Charlesbrown K[my favorite nickname](https://github.com/CharlesbrownK))

## Introduction
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and html.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, C, HTML.

Well, I'm a highschool student now!

I started studying Python in 2021 and I know there is still a lot more to learn.

I know that I'm not actually good at writing codes and my codes have tons of problems, so if you find a problem that have to fix in codes, Please don't hesitate to send us a PR. I'd appreciate it!

😀Thank and Have a great day!
