## Introduction
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python and Java.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, MySQL.
- ðŸ”§ The skills I have are Python, MySQL and HTML.
- ðŸ”¥ I want to become a data scientist who can handle servers and databases.

I'm a highschool student now!

I started studying Python in 2021 and I know there is still a lot more to learn.

I know that I'm not actually good at writing codes and my codes have tons of problems, so if you find a problem that have to fix in codes, Please don't hesitate to send us a PR. I'd appreciate it!
