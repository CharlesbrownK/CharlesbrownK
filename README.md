## Introduction
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python and html.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, C, HTML.

Well, I'm a highschool student now!

I started studying Python in 2021 and I know there is still a lot more to learn.

I know that I'm not actually good at writing codes and my codes have tons of problems, so if you find a problem that have to fix in codes, Please don't hesitate to send us a PR. I'd appreciate it!

## Purpose of My Site
I'm just a **High School Developer** with a deep interest in what's called Python in 2021.

**However**, as I continued to code, I felt the need to organize what I had learned and further solve complex structures.

### To Do List

## Finally

ðŸ˜€Thank and Have a great day!
