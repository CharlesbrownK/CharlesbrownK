- 👋 Hi, I’m @Junghoon-Kim(Charlesbrown K)

## <p align="center">Introduction</p>
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and html.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, C, HTML.

Well, I'm a highschool student now!

I started studying Python in 2021 and I know there is still a lot more to learn.

I know that I'm not actually good at writing codes and my codes have tons of problems, so if you find a problem that have to fix in codes, Please don't hesitate to send us a PR. I'd appreciate it!

😀Thank and Have a great day!

## <p align="center">Purpose of My Website</p>
I'm just a **High School Developer** with a deep interest in what's called Python in 2021.

**However**, as I continued to code, I felt the need to organize what I had learned and further solve complex structures.
